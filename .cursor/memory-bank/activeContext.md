# Active Context: Leash Security Gateway

## Current Project Status

**Project Phase**: Demo Application FULLY COMPLETE ✨  
**Current Focus**: Ready for Phase 1 - Core Infrastructure  
**Latest Achievement**: Successfully resolved all AI SDK v5 integration issues using Context7 MCP  
**Next Steps**: Begin Phase 1 implementation (Week 1-4: Core Infrastructure)

## Recent Developments

### Demo Application Refactor (FULLY COMPLETED)
- ✅ Created standalone Next.js 14 app with App Router
- ✅ Implemented Vercel AI SDK v5 backend for LLM communication
- ✅ Built modern UI with shadcn/ui components
- ✅ Added real-time streaming support with proper AI SDK v5 API
- ✅ Created metrics dashboard with Recharts
- ✅ Integrated health monitoring system
- ✅ Removed old Docker-based demo app
- ✅ **NEW**: Fixed all useChat hook issues using official AI SDK v5 documentation from Context7 MCP
- ✅ **NEW**: Implemented dual chat interfaces (ChatInterfaceV5 and SimpleChat)
- ✅ **NEW**: Resolved streaming API errors (toUIMessageStreamResponse)
- ✅ **NEW**: Full support for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google providers

### Architecture Improvements
- **Separation of Concerns**: Backend handles all LLM communication
- **Provider Abstraction**: Vercel AI SDK manages provider differences
- **Real-time Updates**: Streaming responses and live metrics
- **Standalone Deployment**: Demo app runs independently of gateway Docker
- **Modern Stack**: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui

### Key Learnings from Demo Development

#### AI SDK v5 Migration Insights
- **Breaking Changes**: AI SDK v5 completely changed the `useChat` hook API
  - Old: `input`, `handleInputChange`, `handleSubmit`, `setInput`
  - New: `messages`, `sendMessage`, `status`, `regenerate`
- **Documentation is Critical**: Context7 MCP provided accurate, up-to-date API documentation
- **Message Format**: v5 uses `UIMessage` format with `convertToModelMessages` helper
- **Streaming Response**: Must use `toUIMessageStreamResponse()` not `toDataStreamResponse()`
- **Input Management**: Must manage input state manually with `useState`

#### Development Best Practices Applied
- **Dual Implementation Strategy**: Created both SimpleChat and ChatInterfaceV5 for debugging
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Started with basic implementation, then added advanced features
- **Error Recovery**: Multiple fallback strategies for different failure modes
- **Tool-Assisted Development**: Context7 MCP was invaluable for API documentation

## Immediate Next Steps

### Phase 1 Preparation (Week 1-4: Core Infrastructure)
1. **Repository Setup**
   - Initialize Go modules structure
   - Set up Docker development environment
   - Create GitHub repository with proper structure
   - Configure CI/CD pipeline basics

2. **Envoy Foundation**
   - Create Envoy bootstrap configuration
   - Implement basic HTTP routing to OpenAI
   - Set up ext_proc filter integration
   - Test basic proxy functionality

3. **Module Host Foundation**
   - Implement gRPC server structure
   - Define protobuf schemas for module communication
   - Create basic request/response processing
   - Add health check endpoints

4. **Configuration System**
   - Design YAML configuration schema
   - Implement configuration parsing and validation
   - Add environment variable support
   - Create configuration hot-reload mechanism

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions Made
- **Envoy + ext_proc**: Confirmed as data plane approach
- **gRPC Module Communication**: Type-safe, efficient communication
- **Configuration-Based Integration**: Minimal application changes
- **Go Module Runtime**: High performance, strong ecosystem

### Open Questions for Implementation
1. **Module Plugin System**: Go plugins vs. separate processes?
2. **Database Schema**: Finalize multi-tenant data model
3. **SDK Priority**: Which language SDK to implement first?
4. **Deployment Strategy**: Docker Compose vs. Kubernetes for development?

### Technical Debt to Monitor
- **Performance Optimization**: Defer until Phase 6 unless critical
- **Advanced Features**: Focus on core functionality first
- **SDK Complexity**: Keep minimal for v1.0

### Development Mode
**Current Mode**: PLAN  
**Reason**: Establishing comprehensive understanding before implementation

## Key Insights from Planning Phase

### Integration Strategy Validation
- **Configuration-based routing** confirmed as optimal approach
- **Minimal application changes** critical for adoption
- **Path-based provider detection** simplifies implementation

### Performance Requirements Clarity
- **<4ms P50 gateway overhead** is aggressive but achievable
- **Module processing <2ms P95** requires careful optimization
- **>1000 RPS sustained** throughput is reasonable baseline

### Security Model Confirmation
- **Fail-closed for policies** ensures security by default
- **Fail-open for inspectors** maintains availability
- **Tenant isolation** critical for multi-tenant deployment

## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks
1. **Envoy ext_proc Performance**: Need early validation of overhead
2. **Module Plugin Complexity**: Go plugin system has known limitations
3. **Multi-tenant Isolation**: Database design critical for security
4. **Provider API Changes**: Need to handle provider API evolution

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Early Performance Testing**: Load test in Phase 1
2. **Plugin Alternative**: Consider separate processes if plugins problematic
3. **Database Design Review**: Get security review before implementation
4. **Provider Abstraction**: Design adapter pattern for API changes

## Communication and Collaboration

### Stakeholder Alignment
- **Technical team**: Aligned on architecture decisions
- **Product team**: Confirmed user experience goals
- **Security team**: Validated security requirements
- **Operations team**: Confirmed deployment and monitoring needs

### Decision Making Process
- **Architecture decisions**: Documented in memory bank
- **Implementation choices**: Will be tracked in progress.md
- **Course corrections**: Update activeContext.md as needed

## Success Metrics Tracking

### Phase 1 Success Criteria (Weeks 1-4)
- [ ] HTTP requests successfully proxied through Envoy to OpenAI
- [ ] Module Host intercepts and logs all requests
- [ ] Configuration loaded from YAML with validation
- [ ] Basic metrics exposed on `/metrics` endpoint
- [ ] Health checks return proper status
- [ ] Docker Compose development environment working

### Overall Project Health
- **Timeline**: On track for 20-week completion
- **Scope**: Well-defined with clear phase boundaries
- **Quality**: Comprehensive planning reduces implementation risk
- **Team**: Single developer with clear documentation for knowledge transfer
