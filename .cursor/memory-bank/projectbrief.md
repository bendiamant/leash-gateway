# Project Brief: Leash Security Gateway

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: Leash Security Gateway  
**Type**: Open Source LLM Security Gateway  
**License**: Apache 2.0  
**Architecture**: Envoy-based proxy with pluggable module system  

## Core Mission

Build a production-ready LLM security gateway that provides centralized governance, observability, and policy enforcement for LLM traffic through **configuration-based routing** - enabling organizations to secure their AI infrastructure with minimal application changes.

## Key Value Propositions

1. **Minimal Integration**: Applications only need to change base URL configuration
2. **Centralized Governance**: All LLM traffic flows through a single control plane
3. **Pluggable Modules**: Extensible policy system for custom security requirements
4. **Multi-Provider Support**: Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, AWS Bedrock, etc.
5. **Deployment Flexibility**: Self-hosted or SaaS deployment models
6. **Production-Ready**: Comprehensive observability, security, and performance

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Full gateway implementation with Envoy + Module Host
- ✅ TypeScript SDK POC with OpenAI compatibility
- ✅ End-to-end demo application
- ✅ Complete installation and deployment documentation
- ✅ Multi-tenant SaaS capability
- ✅ Production-ready monitoring and observability

## Timeline

**Total Duration**: 20 weeks (5 months)
- Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Weeks 1-4)
- Phase 2: Module System (Weeks 5-7)  
- Phase 3: Provider Integration (Weeks 8-10)
- Phase 4: SDK & Demo App (Weeks 11-13)
- Phase 5: Multi-tenancy & SaaS (Weeks 14-16)
- Phase 6: Production Hardening (Weeks 17-20)

## Target Users

- **Enterprise Security Teams**: Need to govern AI usage across organization
- **DevOps Teams**: Want centralized observability for LLM traffic
- **Compliance Teams**: Require audit trails and policy enforcement
- **Engineering Teams**: Need minimal-friction integration with existing apps

## Competitive Advantage

- **Configuration-based integration** vs complex SDK requirements
- **Open source** with commercial support options
- **Modular architecture** allowing custom policy development
- **Multi-deployment support** (self-hosted + SaaS)
- **Provider-agnostic** approach supporting all major LLM providers
