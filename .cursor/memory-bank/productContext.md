# Product Context: Leash Security Gateway

## Problem Statement

Organizations using LLMs face critical challenges:

1. **Security Blind Spots**: No visibility into what data flows to LLM providers
2. **Compliance Risks**: Inability to enforce data governance policies
3. **Cost Control**: No centralized cost tracking across multiple providers
4. **Integration Complexity**: Existing solutions require significant application rewrites
5. **Multi-Provider Management**: Different APIs and security models per provider

## Solution Approach

### Core Concept: Configuration-Based Routing

**Before (Direct Provider)**:
```
Application → https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions
```

**After (Gateway Routing)**:
```
Application → https://gateway.company.com/v1/openai/chat/completions → OpenAI
```

**Key Insight**: Change only the base URL, not the application code.

## User Experience Goals

### For Developers
- **Minimal friction**: Single configuration change to enable governance
- **Provider flexibility**: Switch between OpenAI, Anthropic, Google seamlessly
- **Backward compatibility**: Existing code works without modification
- **Optional enhancements**: SDK provides additional features when needed

### For Security Teams
- **Complete visibility**: See all LLM traffic in one place
- **Policy enforcement**: Block, transform, or annotate requests based on rules
- **Audit trails**: Full request/response logging with compliance features
- **Real-time monitoring**: Immediate alerts on policy violations

### For Operations Teams
- **Centralized observability**: Metrics, logs, and traces in unified dashboard
- **Performance monitoring**: Track latency, errors, and SLA compliance
- **Cost optimization**: Track spending across providers and teams
- **Deployment flexibility**: Self-hosted or managed service options

## Product Differentiation

### vs. Direct Provider Integration
- **Centralized governance** instead of scattered policies
- **Multi-provider consistency** instead of different APIs
- **Unified observability** instead of fragmented monitoring

### vs. Complex Gateway Solutions
- **Configuration-based** instead of SDK-required integration
- **Open source** instead of vendor lock-in
- **Modular architecture** instead of monolithic policies

### vs. Proxy-Only Solutions
- **Intelligent processing** instead of simple forwarding
- **Pluggable modules** instead of fixed functionality
- **Business logic awareness** instead of protocol-only handling

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Gateway overhead: <4ms P50, <10ms P95
- Throughput: >1000 RPS sustained
- Uptime: >99.9%
- Integration time: <30 minutes

### Business Metrics
- Cost visibility: 100% of LLM spend tracked
- Policy compliance: >99% of requests processed according to rules
- Developer adoption: Time to first successful request <5 minutes
- Security coverage: All sensitive data patterns detected and handled
